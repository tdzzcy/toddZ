Hi there! 👋 I’m Todd Zhang, a senior undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Washington. 🌟

I have a broad interest in robot learning, with a current focus on embodied AI 🤖. I’m fortunate to work as a Research Assistant in Professor [Bolei Zhou](https://boleizhou.github.io/)’s lab, collaborating with researcher [Honglin He](https://dhlinv.github.io/) and guided by Professor Zhou and Dr. [Wayne Wu](https://wywu.github.io/). Together, we developed a simulation platform for embodied AI and autonomous micromobility in urban spaces🏙.
